## Life-history theory 

Relationship between offspring size and performance may persist across generations

. . .

Focal point of the **larger offspring** vs the *smaller offspring*

- More parental resources
- Higher survival
- Higher growth
- Higher reproduction

. . . 

No explanation for variation in offspring size within populations of the same species.

### Offspring sizes vary within populations but reasons are unclear {.smaller}

- Game theory incorporates interactions among offspring in a population
- *Trade-off* offspring size & number
- Larger offspring are more competitively superior
- Smaller offspring colonize unoccupied sites because they are more abundant
- Degree of symmetry is crucial to the variation in offspring size

### Classic optimality theory: Smith-Fretwell model (1974)

- Selection on offspring size is stabilizing 
- A single offspring size in a population will maximize maternal fitness
- Mothers trade-off size and number of offspring
- Larger offspring = *performance*
- Smaller offspring = *abundance*
- Predict mean values of offspring & variation *among* populations 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Classic optimality theory: Smith-Fretwell model (1974)

- Game theory incorporates density- and frequency-dependent interactions among offspring in a population
- *Trade-off* offspring size & number: competition-colonization trade-off
- Larger offspring are more competitively superior (win contests)
- Smaller offspring colonize unoccupied sites because they are more abundant
- Degree of symmetry is crucial to the variation in offspring size

#### Comeptition is asymmetric 
- Large offspring are good *competitors* 
- Disproportionately acquire resources relative to size
- Small offspring are good *colonizers*
- No offspring is evolutionary stable
- Variation is maintained

#### Competition is symmetric
- All offspring receive same resources 
- Single offspring size is optimal and exclude other sizes

#### Degree of symmetry affects offspring-size variation
- Competition must be strongly *asymmetric* to account for the colonization advantage of small offspring

#### Game-theoretic models
- Competitive asymmetries and positive-frequency selection cause variation in offspring size

#### Do competitive asymmetries maintain offspring-size variation in natural populations?

**Larger offspring** win contests over smaller offspring

- More energy reserves & use *proportionately* less reserves during development
- More energy for growth, survival, reproduction
- Resistance 
- Smaller offspring colonize unoccupied sites because they are more abundant
- Degree of symmetry is crucial to the variation in offspring size

##### *In-situ* experiment

![](experiment.jpg){fig-align="center" width="55%" height="55%"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Results
Focals from **larger** vs. smaller offspring:

1. Higher survival
2. Larger growth
3. Higher reproduction

- Focals from larger offspring survived better than those from smaller offspring ($X^{2} = 7.961$, $df = 1$, $P = 0.005$) - *no neighbor size effect*.

- **Larger growth**

- Larger offspring = larger colonies ($F_{1,105} = 7.590$, $P = 0.007$) - *no neighbor size effect*.

- **Higher reproduction**

- Larger offspring had higher probability of reproducing than smaller offspring ($X^{2} = 13.644$, $df = 1$, $P = <0.001$) - *no neighbor size effect*.

### Discussion {.smaller}

#### Review of Results

- Contradiction to game-theoretic models that strong competitive asymmetries favor larger offspring (Gertitz 1995; Gertitz et al. 1999)

- Offspring size altered the strength and direction of pairwise interactions

- Focal offspring size determined interactions: + or -

- Neighbors facilitated smaller offspring but competed with larger offspring

- Offspring size of neighbors determined strength of interaction

- Neighbors from larger offspring were both strongest facilitators and competitors, respectively

- Asymmetric facilitation (Lin et al. 2012; Schob et al. 2014)

- Small offspring receive benefits from larger offspring

- Large offspring only experience competition

- Reciprocal interactions are $+/-$

### Discussion {.smaller}

#### Explanations for asymmetric facilitation

- Correlations between offspring size and other traits that determine resource supply and demand

- Physical structure of organisms can disrupt boundary currents and increase entrapment of resources that result in facilitation (Cameron et al. 2016; Cardinale et al. 2002).

- Larger offspring grew into larger colonies that may disproportionately disrupt flow and increase resources

- **High flow environments**

### Discussion {.smaller}

#### How does asymmetric facilitation affect variation in offspring size?

- Size-mediated facilitation generates *negative frequency-dependent* selection on offspring size (Day & Young 2004).

- Large offspring performed best in isolation - advantageous when population densities are low and large phenotypes are rare.

- Frequency of large offspring increases - performance will decrease due to intra-phenotpyic competition

- Smaller offspring will 

- Cycles in the abundance of offspring cycles: neither small nor large will be competitively excluded and both will remain *rare* 

- **Fig. 1B**: Small and large offspring were rare in this study 

- Support for the prediction that **asymmetric facilitation and frequency dependence shape offspring-size distributions**

#### Game-theoretic models

- Frequency-dependent consequences of offspring size (Geritz 1995; Gertiz et al. 1999).

- Include facilitation

- Include how resources vary with local sizes and densities of offspring (via *asymmetric facilitation*)

### Discussion {.smaller}

#### Stress-tolerant models

- Other models of offspring size (D-Andrea et al. 2013; Muller-Landau 2010)

- Larger offspring are more stress-tolerant and competitively superior (Gertiz 1995) and win more stressful sites

- Samller offspring are more abundant so win at *less stressful* sites

- **Framework**

- Smaller offspring were advantageous when stress was redecued via *facilitation* and not *fecundity*

- Larger offspring won when stress was high in *neighbor-free* conditions
