#### The main issues

::: incremental
-   Stress of being a graduate student
    -   Relocation
    -   Coursework
-   Naive about authorship credit
    -   Minimal training in authorship ethics
    -   Abuses can erode confidence
-   Imbalance of power
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}

Academic advisors and committee members should properly guide and teach research ethics to graduate students. 

:::

::: notes

Become subject to exploitation and often lack confidence to assert their credibility as early researchers who can participate in the scientific process.

-   Currency for credit

-   Professors & tenure

-   Graduate students & scholarships
:::

::: notes
Since the 1950s, the number of manuscripts with multiple authors has risen due, in part, to the increase in multidisciplinary research projects; as a consequence, the deleterious effects of abusing authorship credit on graduate students' well-being and valuation in the scientific community needs more discussion.

-   **Coersion**

    -   Superior intimidates a student

-   **Honorary**

    -   Individual with no contribution

        -   Favor

        -   Solicitation

        -   Reciprocation

-   **Ghost**

    -   Contributor is denied

        -   e.g., student's name is not included
:::

::: notes
-   Coercion is a type of scientific misconduct that often occurs when an individual in a senior academic position intimidates subordinates, such as graduate students, to gain authorship credit

-   Honorary authorship occurs when an individual receives authorship credit without contributing any significant amount of content, like writing or revision, to the manuscript

-   Senior researchers may give authorship credit to colleagues as a favor for reciprocation

-   Honorary authorship can often depreciate the quality of work a graduate student's accomplishes in the manuscript writing process

#### What's the big deal?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
##### Comeptition is asymmetric

-   Large offspring are good *competitors*
-   Disproportionately acquire resources relative to size (Weiner 1990)
-   Small offspring are good *colonizers*
-   No offspring is evolutionary stable
-   Variation is maintained
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
##### Competition is symmetric

-   All offspring receive same resources (Weiner 1990)
-   Single offspring size is optimal and exclude other sizes (Geritz 1995; Gertiz et al. 1999)
:::
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Important prediction of the Smith-Fretwell model (1974)

-   Competition must be *strongly asymmetric* to overcome the colonization advantage of smaller offspring.

-   **Degree of asymmetry** is crucial for the maintenance of offspring-size variation (Geritz et al. 1999).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Do competitve asymmetries maintain offspring-size variation in natural populations?

#### Do larger offspring always win contests over small ones?

-   **Larger offspring** have more energy for growth, survival, and reproduction
-   Higher energy reserves
-   Use proportionately less vs. smaller offspring (Leishman et al. 2000, Pattersen et al. 2015, 2017)
-   Resistance to starvation and low resource environments
-   Access more resources when feeding starts - but disproportionately more required for asymmetric competition (Marshall et al. 2018, Weiner 1990)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Do competitve asymmetries maintain

#### Do larger offspring always win contests over small ones?

-   **Smaller offspring** require less resources
-   Tolerate resource depletion better than larger offspring (Persson 1985)?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Study species

*Begula neritina* is a bryozoan common to sessile marine communities worldwide.

##### Experiment: Does offspring size generate intraspecific competitive asymmetries?

![](experiment.jpg){fig-align="center" width="60%" height="60%"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Offspring sizes

![](Fig1ab.jpg){fig-align="center" width="60%" height="60%"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Results

![](Fig2A.jpg){fig-align="center" width="40%" height="40%"}

-   Focals from larger offspring survived better than those from smaller offspring ($X^{2} = 7.961$, $df = 1$, $P = 0.005$) - *no neighbor size effect*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Growth and Reproduction

-   Larger offspring $\to$ larger colonies ($F_{1,105} = 7.590$, $P = 0.007$) with *no neighbor size effect*.

-   Larger offspring had higher probability of reproducing than smaller offspring ($X^{2} = 13.644$, $df = 1$, $P < 0.001$) with *no neighbor X size effect*.

-   Probability that focals reproduced was lower in presence of neighbors vs. neighbor-free ($X^{2} = 3.865$, $df = 1$, $P = 0.049$) & *consistent across focal sizes* (focal size x neighbor presence: $X^{2} = 0.37$, $df = 1$, $P = 0.541$).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Offspring size of neighbors determined strength of interactions

![](Fig2B.jpg){fig-align="center" width="40%" height="40%"}

-   Reproductive output of focal colonies was affected by *their own original* offspring size & *original* size of neighbor ($F_{1,133} = 4.511$, $P = 0.036$).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Neighbors facilitated smaller offspring but competed with larger offspring

-   **Isolation:** Offspring produced had 5X output vs. small offspring.

-   **Pairwise interactions:** *Original* size of focal offspring determined their own response to neighbors.

-   *Meaning*... neighbors increased the fecundities of smaller offspring but diminished the fecundities of larger offspring.

-   Size neighbors determined the strength of these interactions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Facilitation

**Increased with neighbor size**

-   Largest neighbors were strongest facilitators of

-   *Meaning*... neighbors increased the fecundities of smaller offspring but diminished the fecundities of larger offspring.

-   Size neighbors determined the strength of these interactions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### To review

-   Larger offspring: (1) survival advantage and (2) higher chance of reproducing

##### However, in the presence of neighbors...

-   Smaller offspring that survived to reproduce had higher reproductive output vs. larger offspring

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Neighbors facilitated smaller offspring

![](Fig2C.jpg){fig-align="center" width="30%" height="30%"}

-   **Composite fitness** = fecundity x probability of reproducing \[survival to maturity, whether survivors reproduced\]

-   Neighbors reduced probability that focals reproduced

-   $[+]$ effect on fecundities of smaller offspring outweighed the $[-]$ effect

-   **Negibores factilitated smaller offspring**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Fecundity costs of making larger offspring

![](Fig2D.jpg){fig-align="center" width="40%" height="40%"}

-   Mothers have higher fitness returns with many smaller vs. few larger *when offpsring interact*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### This study was the first to show that asymmetric facilitation can occur between offspring of different sizes.

-   Contradiction to game-theoretic models that strong competitive asymmetries favor larger offspring (Gertitz 1995; Gertitz et al. 1999)

-   Offspring size altered the strength and direction of pairwise interactions

-   Focal offspring size determined interactions: $+/-$

-   Neighbors facilitated smaller offspring but competed with larger offspring

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Discussion

-   Offspring size of neighbors determined strength of interaction

-   Neighbors from larger offspring were both **strongest** *facilitators* and *competitors*, respectively

-   **Asymmetric facilitation:** small offspring received benefits from larger offspring, but large offspring only experienced competition (i.e., reciprocal interactions are $+/-$) (Lin et al. 2012; Schob et al. 2014).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Potential mechanism fo asymmetric facilitation

#### High flow environments

-   Correlations between offspring size and other traits that determine resource supply and demand.

-   Physical structure of organisms can disrupt boundary currents and increase entrapment of resources that result in facilitation (Cameron et al. 2016; Cardinale et al. 2002).

-   Larger offspring $\to$ larger colonies that may disproportionately disrupt flow and increase resources.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Benefit of resource amelioration

-   Smaller offspring $\to$ small colonies that are not efficient at acquiring resources (Cameron et al. 2016; Okamura 1984).

-   Larger offspring acquire resources more efficiently but receive less in presence of neighbors (i.e., competition) (Okamura 1984).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### How does asymmetric facilitation affect variation in offspring size?

-   Size-mediated facilitation generates *negative frequency-dependent* selection on offspring size (Day & Young 2004).

-   Large offspring performed best in isolation - advantageous when population densities are low and large phenotypes are rare.

-   Frequency of large offspring increases - performance will decrease due to intra-phenotpyic competition

-   Smaller offspring will first increase due to facilitation, then decline as large offspring become more abundant

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Game-theoretic models

-   Frequency-dependent consequences of offspring size (Geritz 1995; Gertiz et al. 1999).

-   Include facilitation and how resources vary with sizes and densities of offspring (via *asymmetric facilitation*) (Gertitz 1995; Geritz et al. 1999).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Incorporate positive interactipns in stress-tolerant models

-   Facilitation and spatial heterogeneity in stressful environments (D'Andrea et al. 2013; Muller-Landau 2010)

-   Larger offspring are more stress-tolerant and competitively superior (Gertiz 1995) and win *more stressful* sites.

-   Smaller offspring are more abundant so win at *less stressful* sites

#### This study provided evidence

-   Smaller offspring were advantageous when stress was reduced via *facilitation*

-   Larger offspring won when stress was high in *neighbor-free* conditions
