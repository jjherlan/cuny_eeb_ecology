#### Life-history theory 

Relationship between offspring size and performance may persist across generations

. . .

Focal point of the **larger offspring** vs the *smaller offspring*

- More parental resources
- Higher survival
- Higher growth
- Higher reproduction

. . . 

No explanation for variation in offspring size within populations of the same species.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Offspring sizes vary within populations but reasons are unclear {.smaller}

- Game theory incorporates interactions among offspring in a population
- *Trade-off* offspring size & number
- Larger offspring are more competitively superior
- Smaller offspring colonize unoccupied sites because they are more abundant
- Degree of symmetry is crucial to the variation in offspring size

##### Classic optimality theory: Smith-Fretwell model (1974)

- Selection on offspring size is stabilizing 
- A single offspring size in a population will maximize maternal fitness
- Mothers trade-off size and number of offspring
- Larger offspring = *performance*
- Smaller offspring = *abundance*
- Predict mean values of offspring & variation *among* populations 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Classic optimality theory: Smith-Fretwell model (1974)

- Game theory incorporates density- and frequency-dependent interactions among offspring in a population
- *Trade-off* offspring size & number: competition-colonization trade-off
- Larger offspring are more competitively superior (win contests)
- Smaller offspring colonize unoccupied sites because they are more abundant
- Degree of symmetry is crucial to the variation in offspring size

##### Comeptition is asymmetric 
- Large offspring are good *competitors* 
- Disproportionately acquire resources relative to size
- Small offspring are good *colonizers*
- No offspring is evolutionary stable
- Variation is maintained

##### Degree of symmetry affects offspring-size variation
- Competition must be strongly *asymmetric* to account for the colonization advantage of small offspring

##### Game-theoretic models
- Competitive asymmetries and positive-frequency selection cause variation in offspring size

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Do competitive asymmetries maintain offspring-size variation in natural populations?

**Larger offspring** win contests over smaller offspring

- More energy reserves & use *proportionately* less reserves during development
- More energy for growth, survival, reproduction
- Resistance 
- Smaller offspring colonize unoccupied sites because they are more abundant
- Degree of symmetry is crucial to the variation in offspring size

##### Experiment

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Offspring sizes

![](Fig1ab.jpg){fig-align="center" width="60%" height="60%"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Results

![](Fig2A.jpg){fig-align="center" width="40%" height="40%"}

- Focals from larger offspring survived better than those from smaller offspring ($X^{2} = 7.961$, $df = 1$, $P = 0.005$) - *no neighbor size effect*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Growth and Reproduction 

- Larger offspring $\to$ larger colonies ($F_{1,105} = 7.590$, $P = 0.007$) with *no neighbor size effect*.

- Larger offspring had higher probability of reproducing than smaller offspring ($X^{2} = 13.644$, $df = 1$, $P < 0.001$) with *no neighbor X size effect*.

- Probability that focals reproduced was lower in presence of neighbors vs. neighbor-free ($X^{2} = 3.865$, $df = 1$, $P = 0.049$) & *consistent across focal sizes* (focal size x neighbor presence: $X^{2} = 0.37$, $df = 1$, $P = 0.541$).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Offspring size of neighbors determined strength of interactions

![](Fig2B.jpg){fig-align="center" width="40%" height="40%"}


- Reproductive output of focal colonies was affected by *their own original* offspring size & *original* size of neighbor ($F_{1,133} = 4.511$, $P = 0.036$).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Neighbors facilitated smaller offspring but competed with larger offspring

- **Isolation:** Offspring produced had 5X output vs. small offspring.

- **Pairwise interactions:** *Original* size of focal offspring determined their own response to neighbors.

- *Meaning*... neighbors increased the fecundities of smaller offspring but diminished the fecundities of larger offspring.

- Size neighbors determined the strength of these interactions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Facilitation

**Increased with neighbor size**

- Largest neighbors were strongest facilitators of 

- *Meaning*... neighbors increased the fecundities of smaller offspring but diminished the fecundities of larger offspring.

- Size neighbors determined the strength of these interactions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### To review

- Larger offspring: (1) survival advantage and (2) higher chance of reproducing

##### However, in the presence of neighbors...

- Smaller offspring that survived to reproduce had higher reproductive output vs. larger offspring 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Neighbors facilitated smaller offspring

![](Fig2C.jpg){fig-align="center" width="40%" height="40%"}

- **Composite fitness** = fecundity x probability of reproducing [survival to maturity, whether survivors reproduced]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Fecundity costs of making larger offspring

![](Fig2D.jpg){fig-align="center" width="40%" height="40%"}


- Mothers have higher fitness returns with many smaller vs. few larger *when offpsring interact*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### This study was the first to show that asymmetric facilitation can occur between offspring of different sizes.

- Contradiction to game-theoretic models that strong competitive asymmetries favor larger offspring (Gertitz 1995; Gertitz et al. 1999)

- Offspring size altered the strength and direction of pairwise interactions

- Focal offspring size determined interactions: $+/-$

- Neighbors facilitated smaller offspring but competed with larger offspring

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Discussion

- Offspring size of neighbors determined strength of interaction

- Neighbors from larger offspring were both **strongest** *facilitators* and *competitors*, respectively

- **Asymmetric facilitation:** small offspring received benefits from larger offspring, but large offspring only experienced competition (i.e., reciprocal interactions are $+/-$) (Lin et al. 2012; Schob et al. 2014).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Potential mechanism fo asymmetric facilitation

#### High flow environments

- Correlations between offspring size and other traits that determine resource supply and demand.

- Physical structure of organisms can disrupt boundary currents and increase entrapment of resources that result in facilitation (Cameron et al. 2016; Cardinale et al. 2002).

- Larger offspring $\to$ larger colonies that may disproportionately disrupt flow and increase resources.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Benefit of resource amelioration

- Smaller offspring $\to$ small colonies that are not efficient at acquiring resources (Cameron et al. 2016; Okamura 1984). 

- Larger offspring acquire resources more efficiently but receive less in presence of neighbors (i.e., competition) (Okamura 1984).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### How does asymmetric facilitation affect variation in offspring size?

- Size-mediated facilitation generates *negative frequency-dependent* selection on offspring size (Day & Young 2004).

- Large offspring performed best in isolation - advantageous when population densities are low and large phenotypes are rare.

- Frequency of large offspring increases - performance will decrease due to intra-phenotpyic competition

- Smaller offspring will first increase due to facilitation, then decline as large offspring become more abundant

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Game-theoretic models

- Frequency-dependent consequences of offspring size (Geritz 1995; Gertiz et al. 1999).

- Include facilitation and how resources vary with sizes and densities of offspring (via *asymmetric facilitation*) (Gertitz 1995; Geritz et al. 1999).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Incorporate positive interactipns in stress-tolerant models

- Facilitation and spatial heterogeneity in stressful environments (D'Andrea et al. 2013; Muller-Landau 2010)

- Larger offspring are more stress-tolerant and competitively superior (Gertiz 1995) and win *more stressful* sites.

- Smaller offspring are more abundant so win at *less stressful* sites

#### This study provided evidence

- Smaller offspring were advantageous when stress was reduced via *facilitation*

- Larger offspring won when stress was high in *neighbor-free* conditions
